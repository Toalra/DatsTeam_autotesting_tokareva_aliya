The Service, including the applications Software, is licensed, not sold, to you. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, applications grants you a limited, revocable, nonexclusive, personal, nontransferable license during the term of this Agreement to install and use one (1) copy of the provided version of the applications Software in object code format, to access the Service for internal and personal purposes only. The applications Software is “in use” on a Device for purposes of this paragraph when it is loaded into the temporary memory (e.g., RAM) or installed into the permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM or other storage device) of a Device.</li><li class="ListItem_li__hqNKl">Applications Software License Restrictions. You may not (and may not allow a third party to) rent, lease, sublicense, sell, assign, loan, use for timesharing or service bureau purposes or otherwise transfer the applications software or any of your rights and obligations under this agreement. You may not (and may not allow a third party to): (a) reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble or attempt to reconstruct, identify or discover any source code, underlying ideas, underlying user interface techniques or algorithms of the applications Software by any means whatsoever, except to the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable law; (b) remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary markings; (c) attempt to circumvent any use restrictions; (d) modify or adapt the applications Software, merge the applications Software into another program or create derivative works based on the applications Software; or (e) use, copy or distribute the applications Software without applications’s written authorization, except that you may make one (1) copy of the applications Software for archival or backup purposes only.</li><li class="ListItem_li__hqNKl">Content Restrictions.

You assume all risk and liability for any such prohibited use of copyrighted content.</li><li class="ListItem_li__hqNKl">Recurring Payments for Paid Service using applications Software.When you purchase a subscription to applications’s Paid Service in connection with your use of the applications Software, applications will automatically renew your subscription to the Paid Service at the end of its initial term and at the end of each term thereafter. The renewal term will be for the same period of time as the initial term. This period of time is known as the Subscription Period. At the conclusion of each subscription term, you will automatically be billed for the applications Paid Service for a renewal subscription term lasting a period of time equal to the Subscription Period. The applications Paid Service fee is non-refundable except as expressly set forth in this Agreement. Taxes may apply on the subscription fee. You agree to pay for the subscription that you select for the Paid Service and you authorize us to automatically charge the payment method our service provider has on file for your recurring payments. If the payment mechanism (such as a credit card) we have on file for you is declined for payment of your Paid Service subscription fee, we may retry the payment mechanism at the same or lower rate. If we do not obtain payment, your Paid Service subscription will be canceled. If you provide us with a new form of payment and are successfully charged within 30 days after the renewal date, your new Paid Service subscription term will be based on the original renewal date and not the date of the successful charge. If your Paid Service is terminated, you may be entitled to a refund, subject to limitations provided in Section 9 of this Agreement. You are responsible to canceling your subscription regardless of whether you receive any notice from applications about the renewal of that subscription. In the event that your payment mechanism expires prior to the renewal date of your subscription, you are responsible for updating a new payment mechanism in your applications account before the renewal date of your subscription to the Paid Service. To the fullest extent permitted by law, applications makes no representations or warranties about the continued availability of any particular form of payment method made available for use with the Service. Several methods of cancelling the automatic renewal of your applications Paid Service subscription are available to you, and are described at the website https://support.apple.com/en-us/ . Once you have cancelled your automatic renewal, recurring subscription fees for applications Paid Service fees will no longer be charged to the payment method we have on file for your account, and your subscription will remain active only until the end of the term for which you have fully paid the applications Paid Service fee. Unless you notify us before a charge that you want to cancel or do not want to auto renew, you understand your paid service subscription will automatically renew periodically and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable paid service subscription fee plus any applicable taxes, using any payment method we have on record for you. applications currently uses third-party payment processors for electronic commerce. Our third-party e-commerce payment processor accepts payments through methods detailed on the applicable payment screen, which may include various credit cards. By using such third-party payment processors, you agree to their terms and conditions of use. Such third parties may charge fees to process payments. We may, but are not required to, pay certain fees at our sole discretion. To the fullest extent permitted by law, applications disclaims all liability with regard to any fees or problems you have with third-party payment processors.</li></ol></div><div class="TextPageBlock_textBlock__r9Pf4"><h3 id="" class="TextPageBlock_subtitle__EjzcP">The Service</h3><ol class="TextPageBlock_list__oORWZ"><li class="ListItem_li__hqNKl">Availability.
